! There is a common misconception that using flex-grow will make the items equal in width. This is incorrect. The idea of using flex-grow is to distribute the available space. As you saw in the equation, the width of each flex item is calculated based on its initial width (The width before applying flex-grow).


!If you want to make the flex items equal in width, itâ€™s possible by using flex-basis. I will explain that in the coming sections.
